For snippet 1-3, each of my tests failed. 

Snippet 1: I think that for snippet 1 there is a code change that could be made to make the test execute succesfully with backticks.

Snippet 2: I do think that there is a code change that can be made that can make my program work for nested parantheses and brackets.


Snippet 3: I do think that there is a code change that can be made that would make my program work for newlines in brackets and parentheses.
